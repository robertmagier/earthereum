            <h1>How do I conquer a country?</h1> Pay the Treasurer the current cost of the country using metamask. He will kick out the current leader and you will be new leader! As a going away present the treasure does give the old leader some Ethereum to find a new home. The treasure
            will then raise the price of the country by a certain percentage.
        </div>
        <div class="faq-section">
            <h1>How Many Countries can I control?</h1> You can control as many countries as you can handle! Beware though you will only be able to join 1 alliance.

            <h1>What is the War Timer?</h1> The war timer is the countdown to unrest in the Earthereum World. Once the countdown reaches 100% war is on!
        </div>
        <div class="faq-section">

            <h1> What do I need to do when the War Timer Reaches 100%?</h1> If you are lucky enough to still be a leader of a country when the War Timer expires you will have a couple of things to do! You will now have a chance to win the War Bounty. You will need to pick an alliance and choose who you want to team
            up with. Choose wisely! This is also the time you want to setup some defenses. This will be the only time you have to do that! Your Treasurer knows war is coming and runs away (what a loser!). You cannot lose your country as your treasurer
            is gone. If you do not have a country you must wait until peace has been made and the treasure returns.
        </div>
        <div class="faq-section">

            <h1>What is the War Bounty?</h1>
The War Bounty is the prize given to the winning alliance of the war! The War Bounty gets filled every time a country is conquered. 3% of all those transactions gets pooled into the War Bounty! Also 97% of all attacks during war also get put into the War Bounty. The War Bounty is split between all the winning alliance members who have helped their alliance attack in the war based on how much they have contributed. If you want a piece of the bounty you need to help your alliance win!

        <div class="faq-section">

            <h1>How do I join an alliance?</h1> Alliances can be joined on the website! Go to our page and select which alliance you would like to join. Alliances must remain within 10% total value of each other. If one side is over that value you will only be able to pick the other alliance. Only when the percentage is restored will it be available to pick again. If you do not pick an alliance the game will decide for you!

        </div>
        <div class="faq-section">

            <h1>What happens if an attack gets through?</h1> If an attack gets through this will hurt the value of your country and bring it down. Depending on what attack got through depends on how much value your country has lost. You can only lose 25% of your countries value per War Period. If you have lost 25% of damage your country is deemed to be destroyed and cannot be attacked anymore!
        </div>
        <div class="faq-section">

            <h1>How do you know who wins the war?</h1> Whichever alliance has done the most combined damage will win the War! The War Bounty will be spread to all the alliance members that participated in the war based on the percentage they supplied to the alliance’s effort. The more you help your alliance the more of the bounty you will receive! 5% of the bounty will be rolled over to the next war!

        <div class="faq-section">

            <h1>What happens when war is over?</h1> The treasurer sees peace has come over the land and returns to your country. He will assess the damages and put the new value of the country up for sale again. Anyone can then come in and conquer your land for its new price if it got attacked or the same price if it did not. The war timer resets to its new time to be aware of.
