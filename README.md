Earthereum Strategy Game

This was my first serious block chain project based on Ethereum Smart Contract. Earthereum is smart contract based strategy game where players buy countries and can attack each other and also pay for defences to protect themselves from attacks of their enemies.

There are three types of military attacks:  infantry, tanks, air force. Each attack has different cost and different possibility to harm country being attacked. 
It took me 4 months to deliver this product. It was very good learning experience. I was pretty new to Solidity and Vue.js so this was a good chance to learn new skills. 

#### Technologies: Vue.js, Solidity, Python, Truffle, Metamask.

It is rather spaghett code so it might be very difficult to read and work on. But it works ;)
If you want to check Frontent then go to Ethereum-Frontend and run 
`npm install`
and then 
`npm run dev`
You should be able to see game screen. It is not going to work since you still need backend process working and smart contract
deployed. Starting backend is bit more difficult because you need to create databse. It should be postgres. There is migration file
to use to create schema. Smart contract is in folder 2. Make a flat file and deploy it on some chain. 


It works. But since project was discontinued I am not willing to improve it in the moment. 
But it was fun to develop :)
